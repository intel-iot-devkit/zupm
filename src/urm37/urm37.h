 *
 * @brief API for the DFRobot URM37 Ultrasonic Ranger
 *
 * The driver was tested with the DFRobot URM37 Ultrasonic Ranger,
 * V4.  It has a range of between 5 and 500 centimeters (cm).  It
 * supports both analog distance measurement, and UART based
 * temperature and distance measurements.  This driver does not
 * support PWM measurement mode.
 *
 * For UART operation, the only supported baud rate is 9600.  In
 * addition, you must ensure that the UART TX/RX pins are
 * configured for TTL operation (the factory default) rather than
 * RS232 operation, or permanent damage to your URM37 and/or MCU
 * will result.  On power up, the LED indicator will blink one
 * long pulse, followed by one short pulse to indicate TTL
 * operation.  See the DFRobot wiki for more information:
